# odin-recipes

In this project I created a recipe webiste, that contains 3 different recipes. 
There are 4 HTML Pages:
1. index.html - the home page
2. enchiladas.html - first recipe
3. friedapples.html - second recipe
4. mapleglazedcarrots.html - third recipe

Each recipe page includes the following: 
* name & photo of the recipe
* ingredient list 
* steps on how to make the recipe 
* link back to the home page

In this assignment I practised the followign:
1. creating multiple HTML pages, with links between each page.
2. Practised the difference between UL and OL lists 
3. Adding Images to the pages.
4. How to regularly commit to github.
